Please let us know if Marlin misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!


## Operational characteristics

- All motors X,Y,Z,E0,Z2
- SD Card
- Bed and hotend Temp 
- Z probe, filament runout and end stops
- Heat bed heater (inverted pin, **be very careful and make sure you have the line #define HEATER_BED_INVERTING TRUE**)
- Hotend heater
- EEPROM emulated on SD Card
- Wifi UART
- Buzzer
- Touch Screen
- Definition created for trigorilla pro board and pins

## To do list

- LCD FSMC (small)
- Power Loss detect (maybe works)
- I2C EEPROM (soft I2C, is connected to pins of the FSMC interface PG0, PG1)
- SPI Flash

## Notes
- This version is not supported by the stock bootloader, you will need a USB debugger(ST-LINK).

## How compile and flash Trigorilla Pro

- ## ¿What do you need?
 - ST-LINK USB debugger or ST development board like NUCLEO Boards
 - [STM32 ST-LINK Utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html#get-software)
 - Dupont Jumper cables 
 - Soldering iron
 - Male Pin Header 
 - If you don't know how to weld, go very carefully haha

- ## Steps to build and flash
 - How compile [Marlin.org Tutorial](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html)
 - If you got some errors, try use [Auto Build Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio.html#auto-build-marlin)
 - **Turn off and disconnect AC power**
 - Cut and weld jumper cables ![welded cables](/Images/SWD_pins.png)
 - Move the jumper SW1 to USB and remove JP1 jumper ![welded cables](/Images/JUMPERS.png)
 - Connect the SDW pins (SWDIO, SWCLK and GND) to your debugger **don’t need VCC**
 - Plug the USB cable on trgirilla pro, the board will be start booting
 - Open STM32 ST-LINK Utility ![STM32 Utility](/Images/STM32%20ST-LINK%20Utility.png)
 - Open file (1), browse this route Marlin-Anycubic-Predator-Trigorilla-PRO\.pio\build\trigorilla_pro and select firmware.bin
 - Click connect to target (2), program (3) and start (4)
 - **Disconnect usb debugger before testing or motors will stutter**
 - **Finished!**


## Marlin 2.0

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
